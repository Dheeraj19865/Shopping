**ShoppingList Project**

This project demonstrates the use of an `ArrayList` to create a simple shopping list application in Java. It allows users to:

* Specify the number of items on the shopping list
* Enter the items for the list
* Indicate the number of items that have been purchased
* Remove purchased items from the list
* Print the remaining items on the list


**Example Usage:**

The program will prompt you to enter the number of items on your shopping list, followed by each item individually. Then, it will ask you to enter the number of items you have purchased and prompt you to enter each purchased item. Finally, it will print the remaining items on your list.

Here's an example interaction:

```
Enter Number of items.
3
Enter 3 items.
Milk
Bread
Eggs
Enter Number of Purchased items.
2
Enter 2 Number of Purchased items.
Milk
Bread
```

Output:

```
Eggs
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be extended to include features like saving and loading shopping lists.
* You can modify the code in the `ShoppingList.java` file to customize the behavior of the application.
